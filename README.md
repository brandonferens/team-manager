# Team Manager

This is a fairly simple a straight forward application. Create teams, create players, enjoy!

### Setup

After cloning or downloading, run in either Laravel Valet or Homestead. A sqlite database was used for this project so no need to setup anything else up. The database can be found at database/database.sqlite. It is already seeded with some data.

Make sure to duplicate .env.example and name it .env. That will ensure everything is setup properly.

Lastly, you can login using the email 'user@teams.io' and password 'secret'.

Enjoy!
